Node has become one of the biggest success stories and failures of open source.
In January of 2014 a bounch of active contributors to the Node.js project became
increasingly conserned about the decrease in contibutors and new realses of Node.js.

At this time Node.js was run by Joyent with the BDFL model. A the concerned
contributors asked Joyent if they (the community) could take over Node.js and
started a process. It was rocky and a bit up and down. Joyent got a new CEO,
Scot Hammond, and he got involved and built out an Advicory Board.

But the progress slow and involved a bounch of involved companies getting
together in a room and trying to solve the various problems. The big probelm
with this process was that the open source contributors of the open source
community was left out and was not not in a positition to fix the problem with
Node.js slowing down. Having a room full of companies does not fix that.

Around the same time as the Node.js Avisory Board was fomalized a project named
Node Forward was initiated. Node Forward would try to formalize and galvanize
some of the problems around some of the higher level problems of Node.js. For a
short time there was a fork of Node.js landing patches. Node Forward was
informed by Joyent (who owned the trademarks to Node.js) that the fork was a
trade mark violation whiched forces Node Forward to make the fork private.

Fedor Indutny (a core contributor to Node.js and a member of the Node Forward)
pushed the fork button on GitHub and renamed the fork io.js which would not
infringe on the Node.js trademark. Within a short period of time the rest of the
active contributors moved to the io.js fork, except for those emplyed by Joyent ofcours.
