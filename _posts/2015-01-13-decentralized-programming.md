<p class="lead">For much of my career as a software developer I have been working
remote. First as an independent consultant during my studies and later as a full
time systems engineer at the Norwegian Trekking Association (DNT).</p>

Let the record show that I absolutely love working remote. It suits me very well
and I have always been under the impression that technology has progressed
enough to make remote work fully feasible. However, I must admit, there have
been some challenges along the way â€“ most of them non-technical ones.

### Our team

Our team is super small. It consists of one other developer @kvikshaug, our
fronted and ux consultant, the glorious project manager, and me. I am located in
Bergen (west coast of Norway), our ux-guy works from Trondheim (the middle of
Norway) and the rest (the other two) are located at DNT's central administraion
in Oslo (capital of Norway).

Luckily for me, the Trekking Association has a regional branch in Bergen where I
can work from. The regional branches are where the trails, cabins, and organized
hikes are managed while the central administration deals with lobbying, marketing,
communication, and manages most of the IT infrastructure.

### Hello world

<blockquote>
  <p>If you get seperated from the rest of your team, your #1 priority changes
  to reestablishing communication.</p>
</blockquote>

This is a well known fact from the military world that applies to decetralized
software teams as well. If you get seperated, volentary or involentary, you must
first set up decent communication channels.

Establish communication becomes number 1 priority.

Informal communication are important

Be a catalyst for change.
