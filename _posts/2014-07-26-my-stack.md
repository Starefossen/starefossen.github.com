<p class="lead">Like most developers, I presume, I have my perfect setup,
tailored to my needs, and perfected over the years. I call it - my very own
software stack! In this post I will explain the most essential parts of it.</p>

### Physical Layer

On the bottom of my stack is a MacBook Pro. However this choice is mostly due to
old habits, and a little bit taste in hardware aesthetics. For the most part I
live in the terminal, so my stack runs on virtually any \*nix based operating
system.

### Data Link Layer – The Terminal

![The Terminal](/uploads/2014/07/26/terminal.png)

What essentially glues my stack together is the `terminal`. I'm not saying anything
bad about <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUIs</abbr>, and I can most
certainly enjoy a graphical interface as much as the next developer. All I am
saying is – being comfortable with the terminal makes life as a developer so much
easier. Trust me!

Most developer tools are <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> based
tools, or at least they ships with one pre-installed, right??!! This makes it
possible to automate and integrate your developer tools to suite *your* needs
and *your* workflow – not the other way around!

**PS!** If you are sick and tired of

[#bashbug](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BashBug) be sure to check out `fish
shell`[5].

### Network Layer – Distributed Version Control

![Version Control All The Things](/uploads/2014/07/26/git.png)

A distributed version control system, such as `git`[1], is an integral part of
my stack. It puts all the things under revision; nothing is ever lost, and any
change can be rolled back in a blink of an eye. Since it is distributed it makes
it possible to sync everything between all of your machines.

All of my configuration files (also known as <i>dotfiles</i>, get it?) are under
version control. You can check them out on this [GitHub
repo](https://github.com/starefossen/dotfiles) along with the rest of my
personal projects.

### Transport Layer - Tmux

![Tmux - terminal multiplexer](/uploads/2014/07/26/tmux.png)

Being fluid in the command line has it's benefits. However, screen real estate
is very valuable and often you can not affording to fill your entire screen with
just one window. This is where a terminal multiplexer, such as `tmux`[2] or `gnu
screen`[3], comes in handy.

A terminal multiplexer, as the name suggests, allows a user to access multiple
separate terminal sessions inside a single terminal window. The multiplexer will
keep all of your sessions allive even when if you close the terminal.

My usual workspace involves a primary section on top, about 70% of the screen,
this is where I run my editor. The rest of the screen is horizontaly split in
equal sized sections depending on the width of the monitor I'm working on. These
sections are used for all sort of stuff you need to do while programming;
running tests, debuggin, version control etc. to mention a few.

Keep in mind, this is my default configuration for new windows, and I change it
depending the project or task at hand with a few simple shortcuts. Also, be sure
to check out my [tmux cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/Starefossen/5955406)
if you want get the most out of tmux.

### Application Layer - Vim

To quote from one my favourite programming books:

That is why the `Vim` editor is the final layer in my stack. It is such an
integral part since programming is, when all comes to all, just text. Also, vim
integrates very nicely with the rest of the layers – it runs in the terminal and
thus runs in tmux.

However, vanilla is nice and well, it's even better with
